Changes since the last public release (1.2.43):

version 1.2.45 [July 7, 2011]

  Fixed uninitialized memory read in png_format_buffer() (Bug
    report by Frank Busse, related to CVE-2004-0421).
  Pass "" instead of '\0' to png_default_error() in png_err().  This mistake
    was introduced in libpng-1.2.20beta01.
  Check for up->location !PNG_AFTER_IDAT when writing unknown chunks
    before IDAT.
  Ported bugfix in pngrtran.c from 1.5.3: when expanding a paletted image,
    always expand to RGBA if transparency is present.
  Check for integer overflow in png_set_rgb_to_gray().
  Check for sCAL chunk too short.
